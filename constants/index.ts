    message: `I started first with one sound healing session and I felt so deeply connected and so many benefit
between body mind spirit that I decided to do the sound healing course. I had already done a course
before but with Amit has been in another level. After that I also did Reiki with him. I was really amazed
by the real passion and the high knowledge of the Master Amit. Not only by sound healing or reiki, but
about yoga Meditacion kundalini and to cultivate a balanced lifestyle.
If you come to Nepal I Highly recommend Vedic healing for session and courses and also for buying
Tibetans sounds bowls or others like Tingsha etc â€¦ Amit Thank you thank you thank you again !!!!!!! And
hopefully see you soon`,
